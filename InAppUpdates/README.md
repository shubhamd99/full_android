## In-App Updates

- In-app updates prompt active users to update your app directly from within the app itself.
- In-app updates are supported on devices running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher.
- Note: APK expansion files (.obb files) are not compatible with in-app updates.
- These provide background download and installation, allowing users to continue using the app while the update is in progress.
- These are fullscreen prompts that require users to update and restart the app to continue using it.
- To support in-app updates, use the Google Play Core libraries.
